### Data Science

#### 1. Learn Python
   
Udemy Option: [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=ST15MT31224)

It’s “100 days” and I assume you’re going to spend about 2-3 hours a day on this. If you can manage more, then you might knock out “two days” in one day sometimes.

Free Option: [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VElWbND-zg&list=PLZPZq0r_RZOOkUQbat8LyQii36cJf2SWT)

This one is free and quite funny at times, it pairs best with [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).

#### 2. Add SQL ( 20 Days In)

[The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp: Go from SQL Beginner to Expert](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/?couponCode=ST15MT31224)

This is a MySQL bootcamp, and lots of what you see out in the real world is MySQL. With that said, once you learn MySQL, it’s basically easy to move to MariaDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL (better known as Postgres), etc.

SQL is more about logic and understanding the basics than anything else. I am convinced that most people can become SQL experts in under a year. You can get functionally employable in under six months. Easy.

#### 3.  The "coding wall" (30 Days In)

Seriously. This is where we take a break and get into some theory. You’ve seen how Python and SQL can work, you have some understanding, and now it’s time for the same exact Harvard course that people literally pay for at Harvard… but for free. CS50 is a series of Harvard lectures that are very much worth the Ivy League brand. I watched this later in my career and I was like, “Damn. So that’s why we do what we do.”
It’s a good place to start understanding the concepts

Take (CS50x 2024)(https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/), and complete the whole course. Take notes and watch it again, its worth it to solidify in your mind.

#### 4. DevOps .... Docker, Kubernetes, Git and More! (60 Days In)

##### Docker and Kubernetes

The Paid Way: [Docker Mastery: with Kubernetes +Swarm from a Docker Captain](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery/?couponCode=ST15MT31224)

The Free on YouTube Way: [Nina teaches you Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c-iBn73dDE)

##### Git and Github

The Paid Way: [The Git & Github Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-bootcamp/?couponCode=ST15MT31224)

The Free Way: [Git and GitHub Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRZGeaHPoaw)

Git, the brainchild of Linus Torvalds (yes, the Linux guy), is like a magical time-traveling tool for code. It's a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows you to save different versions of your project (these saves are called "commits") and switch between them like you're zipping through time. It's also an excellent team player, enabling multiple developers to work on the same project without tripping over each other's code. Plus, it lets you create parallel universes (known as "branches") where you can experiment without messing up your main codebase. Figuring out Git commands might feel like deciphering ancient hieroglyphics, but once you get the hang of it, it's a real game-changer. Git is basically the superhero of the coding world, saving coders from disaster one commit at a time.

#### 5. Tool Time.... (100 Days In)

##### Amazon Web Services

Let’s just get this out of the way: I’m going to recommend you start with AWS because it’s more widely adopted.
Azure and Google Cloud are also good, and I do recommend you familiarize yourself with their cloud native offerings. Once again, I am
not picking favorites. 

This will get you started on the basics: EC2, S3, RDS, and the essential
stuff you’ll need to know about provisioning security groups, some DNS
basics, etc.
